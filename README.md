# OncoPredict-Sammy
'The Cancer Risk Predictor' . It is a  machine learning–based cancer risk prediction system using Logistic Regression with a Tkinter GUI for user-friendly risk assessment. Built as an academic and self-learning project.
OncoPredict-Sammy
OncoPredict-Sammy is a machine learning–based cancer risk prediction system designed to estimate the likelihood of cancer based on basic health and lifestyle information. This project was developed as an academic and self-learning initiative to understand the practical application of machine learning in healthcare.
The system uses Logistic Regression to analyze user inputs such as age, BMI, smoking habits, genetic risk, and physical activity levels. A simple and user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) has been created using Tkinter so that users without technical knowledge can easily interact with the model.
### Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
- Learn how machine learning models are built, trained, and evaluated
- Apply data preprocessing and feature scaling techniques
- Develop a user-friendly GUI for real-world usability
- Understand how ML can be applied in healthcare risk assessment

### Features
- Logistic Regression–based classification model  
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling using StandardScaler  
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix  
- Interactive Tkinter GUI for user input  
- Risk probability output in percentage form  
- Clean and simple interface suitable for academic demonstration  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Tkinter  
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Install the required libraries:
3. Open and run the model training notebook to understand model development  
4. Run the GUI notebook to launch the cancer risk prediction GUI

## Output

The system predicts:
a)Whether there is a high / low risk of cancer
b)The probability percentageassociated with the prediction

Limitations
1)This model is trained on a limited dataset
2)Predictions are probabilistic and not medical advice
3)The project is intended only for learning and demonstrate.
